This non-commercial, fanmade project ports the obscure Famciom JRPG, LaSalle Ishii's Childs Quest ( ラサール石井のチャイルズクエスト ) to PC. The objective is to make this delightful and interesting game available to general audiences in the absense of any official ports or remakes. The game includes versions based both on the later fan localization, "Stardom Warriors" as well as a faithful translation of the Japanese original version. The engine for this project is GameMaker.

As for its completion status, the Stardom Warriors version of the game is 100% complete, including the option to play with new bonus content. The Japanese version is roughly 80-90% complete, with only some cutscene dialogue left to be translated. Both version of the game feature upgrades such as the ability to "sprint" on the overworld, a dedicated saving system replacing passwords, minor UI improvements to allow more text on-screen, and more. 

The below video is a short demonstration of the PC port (on the left) and original NES game (on the right) running side-by-side.

The project uses entirely original code with art assets either directly from the original ROM or based on emulated screenshots in FCEUX.
